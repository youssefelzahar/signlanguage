# SignLanguage

A sign language recognition system based on a **Siamese Neural Network** for gesture similarity learning and classification.

---

## Overview

This project implements a **Siamese Network** architecture to recognize sign language gestures by learning to differentiate between pairs of hand images. Instead of traditional classification, the model learns to measure similarity between input images, making it robust for gesture recognition with limited data and variations.

The system aims to help bridge communication between deaf and hearing individuals by translating sign language into text or commands.

## Features

- Uses a CNN Neural Network for learning gesture similarity.
- Learns effective feature embeddings from pairs of sign language images.
- Handles limited training data efficiently by comparing pairs instead of relying on large labeled datasets.
- Real-time gesture detection and comparison.
- Supports both training and inference modes.
